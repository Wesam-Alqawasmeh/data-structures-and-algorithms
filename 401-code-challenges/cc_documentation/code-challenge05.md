## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- I have to write 2 classes in order to create a singly linked list. The first class (Node) should contain two properties the value and next pointer, the second class (LinkedList) should contains the head property and 3 methods for inserting, saerching and returning the values for nodes as a string.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- for insert method: O(n).

- for includes method: O(n).

- for toString method: O(1)
